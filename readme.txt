Display a beautiful responsive menu with dropdown navigation, social media icons and a search bar with the Marketers Delight theme.

== Description ==

Display a beautiful responsive menu with dropdown navigation, social media icons, a search bar, with the Marketers Delight theme. With hooks, this menu can be extended to hold even more content.

This menu looks and functions perfectly on all devices. On larger screens, you'll see a lightweight menu. When you view it on a phone, the menu turns into an easy-to-tap content switcher and stays out of your readers way when you're viewing on mobile.

Note: This plugin was built exclusively for the [Marketers Delight](https://kolakube.com/marketers-delight/) theme by Kolakube and is a free addon for MD customers.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `md-main-menu` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Appearance > Customize to add menu items

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this menu work with my theme? =

This menu plugin was built specifically for the [Marketers Delight](https://kolakube.com/marketers-delight/) theme from Kolakube.

= How many dropdown menus can I have? =

This menu only supports an unlimited level of dropdown items on all devices.

= Where is the menu added? =

The main menu is added to your blog homepage and archives by default. You may add the Main Menu to any post or page by clicking “Add Main Menu” in the “Layout” meta box on your post editor. If you want to add the Main Menu to every page by default, from your Dashboard go to `Appearance > Customizer > Layout` and enable the Sitewide setting.

If the Main Menu is enabled site wide, you will have the option to remove it from any individual post or page from the same “Layout” meta box on your post editor. Fine-tune control, baby.

= Can I override the template file and stylesheet? =

Using a Child Theme, you can overwrite the HTML and CSS this plugin uses to display the Main Menu. To do that, browse via FTP to `/wp-content/plugins/md-main-menu` and look for the `/templates/` and `/css/` folder. Each respective folder contains the template file or CSS file. Whichever one you want to edit, open it up and copy the entire contents of the folder.

Then in your child theme, create a folder with the same name as the folder you just copied the file from, and a file with the same name you just copied from. Paste what you copied from the plugin into your new file and save. You may now edit.

For example, if I wanted to edit the template, the file path would be `/wp-content/themes/my-child-theme/templates/main-menu.php`.
